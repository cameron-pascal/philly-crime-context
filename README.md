## Warning
The code contained within this repository is a disgusting mess and may even be slightly toxic. This repository is the culmination of a semester long group project succesfully completed in a week and a half. Any notion of a best practice (the server code is just asking for a SQL injection) was abandoned and visitors should leave now before viewing the code causes them permanent harm. Even so, working on this project was a lot of fun and in the process many new things were learned.
